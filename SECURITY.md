# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository provides scripts and configurations for installing Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter. We aim to support the latest stable versions of these tools at the time of each update. Below are the versions currently considered supported for security fixes:

| Tool            | Supported Versions       |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Grafana         | Latest stable release    |
| Prometheus      | Latest stable release    |
| Node Exporter   | Latest stable release    |

Please ensure you are using the most recent version of this repository and the respective tools, as older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository or its usage of Grafana, Prometheus, or Node Exporter, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Here’s how:

1. **Contact Us**: Email the maintainer at [insert maintainer’s email, e.g., waiyanphyoeoo@example.com] with a detailed description of the vulnerability. If no email is provided in the repository, open an issue labeled "Security" and request private communication.
2. **Details to Include**:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, privilege escalation).
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations (optional).
3. **Response Time**: Expect an initial response within 7 days. We’ll work with you to validate and address the issue.

Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we’ve had a chance to investigate and mitigate it.

## Security Considerations

This repository provides automation for setting up monitoring tools. Be aware of the following security best practices when using it:

- **Script Execution**: Review the scripts before running them, as they may require elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo`). Ensure they align with your security policies.
- **Network Exposure**: By default, Prometheus (port 9090), Grafana (port 3000), and Node Exporter (port 9100) may be exposed. Secure these services with firewalls, authentication, or TLS where possible.
- **Credentials**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in configuration files. Use environment variables or secret management tools instead.
- **Updates**: Regularly update Grafana, Prometheus, and Node Exporter to their latest versions to benefit from upstream security patches.

## Vulnerability Handling

If a vulnerability is confirmed:
- We’ll prioritize a fix based on its severity.
- A new release or commit will address the issue.
- Credit will be given to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested) in the update notes.

For vulnerabilities in Grafana, Prometheus, or Node Exporter themselves, please report them directly to their respective projects:
- [Grafana Security](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/security/)
- [Prometheus Security](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/security/)
- [Node Exporter GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/issues)

## Contributions

Security improvements are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests addressing potential issues or enhancing security features.

### Notes
- This is a generic template since I lack specific details about the repository beyond its implied purpose from the URL and search context. If the repository has unique features (e.g., custom configurations, additional tools), the `SECURITY.md` would need adjustments.
- The email placeholder assumes the maintainer’s GitHub username (`waiyanphyoeoo`). You’d need to replace it with an actual contact method if you’re adapting this.
- If you have access to the repository and it already contains a `SECURITY.md`, let me know what you find, and I can refine this further!

Would you like me to adjust this further based on any specific details you can provide about the repo?
